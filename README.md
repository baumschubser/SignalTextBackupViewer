> :warning: **THIS IS OLD**: This refers to a very old feature of a very old version of Signal (or "TextSecure" what it was called back then). It will not work on current versions of Signal.

# SignalTextBackupViewer
A comfortable view of your SignalPlaintextBackup.xml

![A screenshot of the current version](screenshot.png "This is what it looks like on my PC.")

# Features
* Sorts messages by contact in collapseable threads
* Displays name next to number (if available)
* Marks received and sent messages

# Usage
* Make a backup of your Signal messages in the app
* open index.html with a browser and drag and drop SignalPlaintextBackup.xml from your phone (/sdcard/SignalPlaintextBackup.xml) into it

# Known Issues

* It's super ugly.
